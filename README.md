# One of the Simplest Ways to Build AI in XO: The Minimax Algorithm

This project demonstrates one of the classic methods of building Artificial Intelligence in interactive games —  
the **Minimax Algorithm**, which works perfectly for simple games like **XO (Tic Tac Toe)**.

## What is Minimax?

Minimax doesn't require any training data or a pre-trained model.  
It belongs to the class of **Search-Based AI**, which explores all possible outcomes of a game state and selects the best possible move.

This kind of algorithm is typically used in games where all the information is visible and turns are alternated.  
It aims to simulate every possible outcome and choose the action that leads to the best result,  
even in the worst-case scenario — a concept known as **Optimal Move Selection**.

## Non-Learning AI in Action

This project showcases a working example of a type of Artificial Intelligence called  
**Non-Learning AI**, which is based on logic and decision-making, not on training or data.

## Imperfect AI for a More Realistic Experience

Because Minimax represents a nearly perfect player, it often leads to unbeatable gameplay.  
To simulate more human-like behavior, a small **error rate of 15%** was added —  
a technique known as **Imperfect AI Behavior**, commonly used in AI game development  
to make the experience more balanced and realistic.
